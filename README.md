## hi
Hi, I'm Rex Roof.  I started using screen in the 1990s and switched to tmux in 2015. 
This is talk is about why you should have a virtual terminal.

## what is a virtual terminal?
A window manager for your terminal.  A way to manage multiple login/shell sessions in one terminal.  Gives you a way to manipulate your terminals and detach and reattach from terminal sessions.
